This is the first task of my internship, the objective of this task is :
Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions.
Dataset used : Iris 

In this task, I have successfully loaded the "iris" dataset from seaborn library, I have explored the dataset i.e; features, entries, unique columns etc.
Have successfully printed the statistic of the dataset, using .info() and .describe() methods. And then Finally, I have visualied the dataset using matplotlib, 
used scatter plot to show the relationship between features, used histograms to show the distributions, and then  finally used box plots to identify the outliers.
